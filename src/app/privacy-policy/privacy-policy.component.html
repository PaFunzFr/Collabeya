        We point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g., when
        communicating by e-mail) may have security gaps. Complete protection of
        data against access by third parties is not possible.

      <h3>
        General Information on the Legal Basis for Data Processing on this
        Website
      </h3>
      <p>
        If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data
        on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR or Art. 9(2)(a) GDPR if special
        categories of data are processed in accordance with Art. 9(1) GDPR. In
        the case of explicit consent to the transfer of personal data to third
        countries, data processing is also based on Art. 49(1)(a) GDPR. If you
        have consented to the storage of cookies or to access to information in
        your end device (e.g., via device fingerprinting), data processing is
        also based on § 25(1) TDDDG. Consent can be revoked at any time. If your
        data is required for the fulfillment of a contract or for
        pre-contractual measures, we process your data on the basis of Art.
        6(1)(b) GDPR. Furthermore, we process your data if this is necessary to
        fulfill a legal obligation on the basis of Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR. Data
        processing may also be based on our legitimate interest pursuant to Art.
        6(1)(f) GDPR. The relevant legal bases in each individual case are
        explained in the following paragraphs of this privacy policy.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
      <h3>Recipients of Personal Data</h3>
      <p>
        In the course of our business activities, we work together with various
        external parties. In some cases, the transfer of personal data to these
        external parties is also necessary. We only pass on personal data to
        external parties if this is necessary in the context of contract
        fulfillment, if we are legally obliged to do so (e.g., transfer of data
        to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest pursuant to Art.
        6(1)(f) GDPR in the transfer, or if another legal basis permits the data
        transfer. When using processors, we only pass on personal data of our
        customers on the basis of a valid contract for order processing. In the
        case of joint processing, a contract for joint processing is concluded.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
      <h3>Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing</h3>
      <p>
        Many data processing operations are only possible with your explicit
        consent. You can revoke consent you have already given at any time. The
        legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation remains
        unaffected by the revocation.

        RIGHT AT ANY TIME, ON GROUNDS RELATING TO YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION, TO
        OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO
        PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RELEVANT LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH
        PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU OBJECT,
        WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA UNLESS WE CAN
        DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING WHICH
        OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OR THE PROCESSING SERVES
        THE ESTABLISHMENT, EXERCISE OR DEFENSE OF LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION
        PURSUANT TO ART. 21(1) GDPR).
      </p>
      <p>
        IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES, YOU

        CONCERNING YOU FOR SUCH MARKETING; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING TO THE
        EXTENT THAT IT IS RELATED TO SUCH DIRECT MARKETING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR
        PERSONAL DATA WILL THEN NO LONGER BE USED FOR DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES
        (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21(2) GDPR).

      <h3>
        Right to Lodge a Complaint with the Competent Supervisory Authority
      </h3>
      <p>
        In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects have a right to
        lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the
        Member State of their habitual residence, their place of work or the
        place of the alleged infringement. The right to lodge a complaint exists
        without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy.

        You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the
        basis of your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to you
        or to a third party in a commonly used, machine-readable format. If you
        request the direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will
        only be done to the extent that it is technically feasible.

      <h3>Information, Rectification and Deletion</h3>
      <p>
        Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the
        right at any time to free information about your stored personal data,
        its origin and recipients and the purpose of data processing and, if
        necessary, a right to rectification or deletion of this data. You can

      <h3>Right to Restriction of Processing</h3>
      <p>
        You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your
        personal data. You can contact us at any time regarding this. The right
        to restriction of processing exists in the following cases:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If you contest the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we
          usually need time to verify this. For the duration of the review, you
          have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your
          personal data.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the processing of your personal data was/is unlawful, you may
          request the restriction of data processing instead of deletion.
        </li>
        <li>
          If we no longer need your personal data, but you require it for the
          establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims, you have the right
          to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data
          instead of deletion.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you have objected pursuant to Art. 21(1) GDPR, a balance must be
          struck between your interests and ours. As long as it has not yet been
          determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the
          restriction of the processing of your personal data.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, such data –
        apart from being stored – may only be processed with your consent or for
        the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims or for the
        protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for
        reasons of important public interest of the European Union or a Member
        State.
